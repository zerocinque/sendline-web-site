    "paragraph1": "My name is Luigi. I wrote my first lines of code at technical school and never stopped. I worked as a Backend Developer at Deltatre, building platforms that served millions of users. Then as IT Manager at Rogelfrut, where I experienced firsthand what it means to make technology work in a real company — with limited budgets, daily emergencies, and software that won't talk to each other.",
    "paragraph2": "The truth is that SMBs have serious technology problems but rarely find someone who solves them without overcomplicating everything. Big vendors are too expensive and too slow. Generic freelancers lack the big picture. What was needed was a middle ground: someone with real business experience, who develops concrete solutions and works side by side with you.",
    "paragraph3": "That's why I founded SendLine. Automations, ERP integrations, IoT monitoring, AI chatbots — all custom-built, with a single point of contact and no middlemen. If you have a process that's slowing you down, I can probably automate it. If you have two systems that don't communicate, I'll make them talk.",
